**Official demo of Cross-Shaped Heat Tensor Network for Morphometric Analysis Using Zebrafish Larvae.**
<br>

> Deep learning-based morphometric analysis of zebrafish is widely utilized for the non-destructively identification of abnormalities and diagnosis of diseases. However, it poses a significant challenge to obtain discriminative and continuous organ category decision boundaries through direct observation of zebrafish larvae from the outside. To address this issue, this study simplifies the organ areas to polygons and focuses solely on the endpoint positioning. Specifically, we introduce a deep learning-based feature endpoint detection method for quantitatively determining zebrafish larvae's essential phenotype and organ features. We propose the Cross-Shaped Heat Tensor Network (CSHT-Net), a feature point detection framework consisting of a novel keypoint training method named Cross-Shaped Heat Tensor and a feature extractor called Combinatorial Convolutional Block. Moreover, we compiled a dataset of 4,389 bright-field micrographs of zebrafish larvae at 120 h post-fertilization for model training and algorithm evaluation of zebrafish phenotypic traits. The proposed framework achieves an average precision (AP) of 83.2\% and an average recall (AR) of 85.8\%, outperforming multiple widely adopted keypoint detection techniques. This approach enables robust phenotype extraction and reliable morphometric analysis for zebrafish larvae, fostering efficient hazard identification for chemicals and medical products.
