**Official demo of Cross-Shaped Heat Tensor Network for Morphometric Analysis Using Zebrafish Larvae.** 
<br>

> This study introduces a deep learning-based feature endpoint detection method for quantitatively determining the essential phenotype and organ features of zebrafish larvae. Cross-Shaped Heat Tensor Network (CSHT-Net), a feature point detection framework that proposes a novel keypoint training method named Cross-Shaped Heat Tensor and a feature extractor called Combinatorial Convolutional Block, is designed and implemented. A dataset of 2905 bright-field micrographs of zebrafish larvae at 120 h post-fertilisation was collected for model training and algorithm evaluation of zebrafish phenotypes. The presented framework attains an AP of 83.2% and an AR of 85.8%, outperforming multiple widely implemented keypoint detection techniques. This approach enables a robust phenotype extraction and reliable morphometric analysis, fostering an efficient hazard identification for chemicals and medical productions utilising zebrafish larvae.
